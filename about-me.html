        <p class="article-featured-body">I was a very easy going child but as I grew up, thinking about my career came naturally to me there were so many things I liked it was difficult to choose just one of them. </p>
        <p class="article-featured-body">I really liked everything beside what my country had to sell. I went in the direction on my way here music, illustration, graphic design, and played a whole <em>lot of games</em>. So that could be the reason I was thought of as weird. <strong>I started learning programming </strong> found it very fascinating how I can just order the computer to do something for me. From an early age i was very interested in tech so it was only natural</p>
        <p>Now I find myself trying to master web development wanting to see whats out there in the big world, join me in my neat travel adventures.</p>
